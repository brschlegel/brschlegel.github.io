          <p class="lead">I am a developer who loves to solve interesting problems! My areas of interest include making games, specifically the use of AI in games. I am currently working on my Bachelors Degree from Rochester Insititute of Technology, with an expected graduation May 2021. These are some of the skills I've aquired: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Proficiency in C# and C++. I am also familiar with JavaScript and Python </li>
            <li>Experience in Unity and Git, as well as working with and adding to large C++ codebase</li>
            <li>Experience teaching and guiding others being a TA for an introductory CS course</li>

          <h2>Experience</h2>
          <br>
          <h3>CFD Research (Summer 2020)</h3>
          <p class="lead">I was hired as a summer intern at CFD Research Corporation in Huntsville Alabama. I was assigned to the Dynamic Avatar project, which consists of animating 3d Volumetric Tetrahedral meshes of warfighters (I know a mouthful right?) for a Department of Defense customer. To start, I 
            made two GUIs to help outfit the avatars and to create a path for the warfighters to walk along. This was done in Unity, with the main difficulty being saving information in a way that the in-house engine could understand. After this, I was switched to visualizing the animations produced by the in-house engine. What made
            this difficult was transferring data between C++ and C# is hard enough, but conserving the complex structures needed to animate the meshes in an efficient way certainly kept me busy!

          <h3>Teaching Assistant (August 2019 - Present)</h3>
          <p class = "lead">I work as a Teaching Assistant for GDAPS 1 and 2, which serve as the intro to CS courses for our Game Design and Development students at RIT. I teach basic programming principles and good habits in GDAPS 1 for the fall,
            and then teach algorithms and data structures in GDAPS 2 in the spring. This culminates in a semester-long group project that I help guide and mentor. Teaching really is the best way to learn,
            and I feel that my experience helping students write clean and efficient code has improved my skills tenfold.

          <h3>Pandemonium</h3>
          <img id = "pandemonium" src = "pandemonium.PNG" class = "img-fluid">
          <p class = "lead">Pandemonium is a 3D party game with several minigames, made as a semester long project in my Production Studio class. The project was developed in Unity, using GitHub to sync our work
            Early on in the project, I designed our code's architecture, including a collection of Prefabs I called "Props", designed to be very versatile, while still allowing non-programmers
            to use and implement games with them. I also created our character controller, using Unity's new Input System to implement couch multiplayer with controllers. Later on, I pivoted to designing
            computer players to fill in for missing players, so that every minigame had 4 players in it. While getting acquainted with the new input system was good experience, I think the main things I learned from this 
            project was team related. Our team was six members, which is the largest I've worked on so far. Many of the challenges we faced were organizational, as well as communication and making sure we were all on the same page. 
          </p>
          <h3>Genetic Tower Defense</h3>
          <img id = "gtd" src = GTDpic.JPG  class="img-fluid">
          <p class="lead">This project was made in Unity, and was my first introduction to a large scale 3D Unity project. GTD is a tower defense game, in which the enemy stats are determined by a 
            genetic algorithm. This means establishing a "survival of the fittest" for enemy types, with the fitness function being how far down the map they travelled. I followed a tutorial to get the basic set up
            done, but after that I was working entirely on my own, including the genetic algorithm. This project was great as I'm super interested in AI, and it was a unique way to incorporate that into a game. This project taught me 
            important lessons about code architecture, and was my first major personal project. 
          </p>

          <h3>Spooked!</h3>
          <img id = "spooked" src = spookedpicture.JPG  class="img-fluid">
          <p class = "lead">Spooked was a semester long project, worked on with a team of 4. Spooked is a platformer, where your timer and health bar are one and the same. To balance this, the player gets more powerful as their health decreases. The game was made in the MonoGame Framework. My role
            on the team was organizing meetings, as well as enemy design and development. This was my first big group project, as well as my first game! I learned about formatting code in a team-member-friendly way, as well as 
            furthering my skills with Object Oriented Design.
